Macaw is an Android app in **Kotlin** that I'm developing using **Jetpack Compose**.

## What does it do? 🤔

The app let the user record and play voice messages. Simple as that!

## About the project 🎨

The whole purpose of this little project is to get familiar with Jetpack Compose and the declarative UI in general ( although I developed also in Flutter ). I used some
of the main concepts of Compose: UI components (such as LazyColumnFor, Box, Row, Column, Text, Button ... ), Theming, the brand new Navigation framework ( 1.0.0 - Alpha atm )
the state handling and much more.

## Future 📶

I'm maintaining the project and adding new features to it. At the moment I'm working on
1. Audio wave based on its loudness when the user records and plays a media.
2. Sleep talk mode ( yeah weird stuff )
3. Homepage with a custom header item
4. Components refactoring - some of them could be reorganised and reused
5. Repository - the Files fetch shouldn't be in the ViewModel!!
