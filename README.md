Macaw is an Android app in **Kotlin** that I'm developing using **Jetpack Compose**.

## What does it do? ðŸ¤”

The app let the user record and play voice messages. Simple as that!

## About the project ðŸŽ¨

The whole purpose of this little project is to get familiar with Jetpack Compose and the declarative UI in general ( although I developed also in Flutter ). I used some
of the main concepts of Compose: UI components (such as LazyColumnFor, Box, Row, Column, Text, Button ... ), Theming, the brand new Navigation framework ( 1.0.0 - Alpha atm )
the state handling and much more.

## Future ðŸ“¶

I'm maintaining the project and adding new features to it. At the moment I'm working on
1. Audio wave based on its loudness when the user records and plays a media.
2. Sleep talk mode ( yeah weird stuff )
3. Homepage with a custom header item
4. Components refactoring - some of them could be reorganised and reused
5. Repository - the Files fetch shouldn't be in the ViewModel!!
